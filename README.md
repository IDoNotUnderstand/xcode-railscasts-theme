#Description

This Xcode theme is inspired from Simon Wallner 'RailsCast' Xcode Theme. (https://github.com/SimonWallner/RailsCast-Xcode-Theme)
However, I did some changes to original Railscasts inspired theme based on my personal IntelliJ IDEA settings.
I find colors relaxing and consistent. Eye Strain is less and it provide a good focus on code.
